    "trl_intro_05": "In fraction form (x/y), the larger (x) is compared to (y), the more likely the event is. (y) equates to 1.00 for the fraction, with (x) acting as the chance value. The event chance is 0.00 when (x) is equal to 0 and is 1.00 when (x) is equal to (y).",
    "trl_intro_06": "With all that explained, welcome to the overworld! You need to beat the boss to finish the simulation, but they’re behind that scary locked door! Looks like you’ll have to go through a different door for now…",
    "trl_intro_07": "To the left is your health, to the right is your energy, at the bottom is your score, and at the top is the current round number, all of which I’ll elaborate on later. There are also various buttons at the top, so check those out at your leisure.",
    "trl_intro_08": "With all that explained, please select an open door to start your first battle!",

    "trl_battle_00": "Welcome to your first battle, Battle Bot! To win the battle, you must bring your opponent’s health down to 0. But if the opponent brings your health down to 0, you’ll get a game over! To attack your opponent, you must use your battle moves!",
    "trl_battle_01": "You can have up to 4 battle moves at a time, which together with the run and charge moves makes for a total of 6 battle options! To learn a new move, you must accept a move offer, which is given out every time you clear a room.",
    "trl_battle_02": "The charge and run moves are special options that cannot be replaced. The charge move is used to charge your energy, which you need to perform your battle moves, while the run move has you attempt to flee from the battle.",
    "trl_battle_03": "If you run from battle, your health and energy levels stay the same. Your opponent keeps their health and energy levels as well, but they will get restored if you clear too many rooms without defeating them.",
    "trl_battle_04": "With all that covered, time to try out one of your moves! If you want to know what a move does, click the stats button!",

    "trl_firstMove_00": "You just finished your first turn of battle! As you can see, moves have different characteristics that determine how they perform in battle. Every move has at least 4 components, which are as follows: rank, power, accuracy, and energy usage.",
    "trl_firstMove_01": "A move’s rank determines how advanced it is, a move’s power determines how much damage it does, a move’s accuracy determines how likely it is to hit its target, and a move’s energy usage determines how much energy is needed to use said move.",
    "trl_firstMove_02": "If a move does not list one of the four components, then it has unique behaviour that concerns said attribute. On that point, moves can have additional effects as well, which are always explained in their descriptions.",
    "trl_firstMove_03": "Make sure to check the stats window and info window if you ever need more information on your moves! With all that explained, on with the battle!",

    "trl_critical_00": "You have encountered critical damage! Critical damage multiplies the power of a move when it successfully hits its target. Unless a move’s description states otherwise, every directly damaging move has the same critical damage chance.",

    "trl_recoil_00": "You just encountered recoil damage! Some moves deal damage to the user when performed successfully. A move’s description will state if it does recoil damage.",

    "trl_statChange_00": "You have encountered a stat change! A battler’s stats can be temporarily adjusted by certain moves, and by certain game events. These stat changes reset when the battle ends.",

    "trl_burn_00": "You have encountered burn status! A battler inflicted with burn status will take damage every turn. Burn status wears off when the battle ends, for both you and your opponent.",

    "trl_paralysis_00": "You have encountered paralysis status! A battler inflicted with paralysis will move slower and has a chance of missing their turn. Once the battle ends, both you and your opponent are cured of paralysis.",

    "trl_firstBattleDeath_00": "Since this is your first battle, the simulation has completely restored your health and energy! After this battle is over, you will get a game over if you lose all your health.",

    "trl_overworld_00": "Look! The other doors have opened! But the boss door is still locked… I guess you’ll have to clear out all the other rooms before the boss accepts your challenge. But that shouldn’t be a problem.",
    "trl_overworld_01": "As the simulation progresses, you’ll grow stronger, and learn even better moves! Your foes will probably get stronger too, but I’m sure you can handle it! And remember, if you don’t understand something, check out the stats and info windows! Good luck!",

    "trl_treasure_00": "This is a treasure room! If you take the treasure, you’ll get a free level up, and a chance to learn 1 of 3 moves! If you don’t take the treasure, the room will remain open, so you can always come back later.",

    "trl_question_00": "Heads up! You’re about to be asked a question. From this point forward, you’ll get a question every time you clear a room.",
    "trl_question_01": "If you answer correctly, you’ll get a bonus that’ll help you in the next room. But if you answer wrong, you’ll get a penalty for the next room. Good luck!",

    "trl_phase_00": "It looks like you’ve entered a new phase of the simulation! A phase change seems to happen every time you complete a certain of rooms… Interesting!",
    "trl_phase_01": "Hmm… It appears you’ve gotten a permanent stat boost! Cool! But it seems like some of your foes have evolved, and learned new moves… Which is less cool. Well, I’m sure you can handle it! Good luck!",

    "trl_boss_00": "Look! It’s the boss of the simulation! Once you defeat them, the battle simulator will be complete! Good luck!",

    "trl_gameOver_00": "You lost the battle and got a game over! But don’t worry, you can try again! Hmm… It appears that your health and energy have been completely restored, but that some of your battle moves are now different! And on another note…",
    "trl_gameOver_01": "The rooms you cleared are still locked, so I don’t think you have to redo them. I’m guessing the remaining enemies got their health and energy back though… Anyway, this is just a small setback. Remember, you’ve got this! Good luck!",
